# ANN_for_interaction_region_prediction
So here in this repository I have created a Artificial Neural Network which is trained on protein embeddings data that is obtained from Prot-Bert Model. My goal is to find interacting and non-interacting regions in a protein sequence for the Influena-A virus. The main issues while dealing with the protein sequences of Influenza is I dont have PDB fles for some of the sequences. So to find interacting and non-interacting regions I need to solely depend on the protein sequence information. 

So I came up with a approach where I can create a model which makes the interacting region  predictions based on the protein bio chemical properties
